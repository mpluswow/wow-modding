### IMPORTANT :
AIO.Handle or AIO.Msg() functions automatically pass the player object as the first parameter. 
If your client-side function isn't expecting that, it could interpret the player's name (or other attributes) 
as the first piece of data, leading to issues when processing the table of IDs.
