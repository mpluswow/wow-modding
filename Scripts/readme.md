## Table of Contents Descriptions

* **[Eluna LUA Scripts](Eluna/readme.md)**  
  This section contains scripts written in Lua using the Eluna engine, which extends AzerothCoreâ€™s capabilities.  
  These scripts cover creature behavior, game events, custom commands, teleporters,  
  and other gameplay enhancements that can be easily added or modified without recompiling the core.

* **[SQL Query Scripts](SQL/readme.md)**  
  This folder includes SQL scripts designed to be executed directly on your AzerothCore database.  
  They range from creature spawns and game object setups to quest modifications, teleport NPCs, and database cleanups.  
  These queries help you rapidly develop and test custom game content or features.
