# AzerothCore Eluna Script Collection

This repository contains a collection of Eluna Lua scripts made for AzerothCore (World of Warcraft 3.3.5a).
Each folder includes a standalone module that can be placed into your lua_scripts directory.
Some scripts may include DBC or SQL changes, so be sure to check the included readme in each folder for setup details.
These scripts are built to help customize gameplay, streamline server features, and add new systems to enhance the experience.
